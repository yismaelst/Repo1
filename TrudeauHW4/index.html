		<p>Located at the intersection of Frankford and Girard Avenues on the Southern tip of Fishtown, <strong>Johnny Brenda’s</strong> is, at once, the catalyst, champion, living room, kitchen/dining room and concert hall of its burgeoning neighborhood. What was once a rough-around-the-edges neighborhood tavern — with a dilapidated boarding house above it — is now a chronically-filled gastro-pub, where table seats can be few and far between, with a beautifully restored, 250-person live music venue just up the stairs.</p><br>
